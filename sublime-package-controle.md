# Sublime Package Control

In text editor Sublime I install Package Control [1] to be able to install plugins (like 'Indent XML' [2]).

## Installation

Within Sublime, use key combination ```cmd+shift+p``` and search for 'Install Package Control'.

After install is done, use ```cmd+shift+p``` again and search for 'Install Package'.

A new textbox will appear where you can search for the desired plugin (like 'Indent XML').

After plugin installation, you can use ```cmd+shift+p``` again and search for the plugin to execute.
